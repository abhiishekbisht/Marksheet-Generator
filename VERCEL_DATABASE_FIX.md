# Vercel Database Connection Fix

## Problem
Your app is showing "Database connection error!" because Vercel doesn't provide MySQL hosting.

## Solution: Use Cloud MySQL Database

### Option 1: PlanetScale (Recommended - Free Tier)

1. **Sign up at PlanetScale**
   - Go to https://planetscale.com
   - Create free account
   - Create new database (e.g., `marksheet_db`)

2. **Get Connection Details**
   - Click on database
   - Go to "Connect"
   - Select "Connect with: MySQL"
   - Copy the credentials:
     - Host
     - Username
     - Password
     - Database name

3. **Add to Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add these variables:

   ```
   MYSQL_HOST=your-planetscale-host.us-east-1.psdb.cloud
   MYSQL_USER=your-username
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your-password
   MYSQL_DATABASE=marksheet_db
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-change-this
   FLASK_ENV=production
   FLASK_DEBUG=False
   COLLEGE_NAME=GULZAR GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS
   COLLEGE_ADDRESS=Academic Excellence Since 1995
   ```

4. **Redeploy**
   - After adding variables, redeploy your app
   - Or push a new commit to trigger deployment

### Option 2: Railway (Free Tier)

1. **Sign up at Railway**
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Create account
   - Create new project
   - Add MySQL database

2. **Get Connection String**
   - Click on MySQL service
   - Copy connection details
   - Format: `host`, `user`, `password`, `database`

3. **Add to Vercel** (same as above)

### Option 3: AWS RDS (More Complex, Paid)

1. Create RDS MySQL instance
2. Configure security groups
3. Get connection details
4. Add to Vercel environment variables

## Quick Fix for Testing (Not Recommended for Production)

If you want to test quickly, you can:

1. **Use SQLite Instead** (requires code changes)
   - Easier for Vercel
   - But requires modifying your Flask app

2. **Deploy on Different Platform**
   - Use **Railway** or **Render** which provide MySQL
   - These platforms are better for full-stack apps with databases

## After Setting Up Database

### Initialize Database Tables
After connecting to cloud MySQL, you need to run:

```bash
# Connect to your cloud MySQL and run init_db.py
python init_db.py
```

Or manually create tables using the MySQL console of your cloud provider.

## Recommended: Use Railway Instead of Vercel

Railway is better suited for your Flask + MySQL app:

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Create new project
3. Add MySQL database (automatic)
4. Deploy your Flask app
5. Railway handles both app and database!
