## 🎤 SPEAKING POINTS

### Introduction:
"Good morning/afternoon. I'm [Name] and I'll be presenting our Student Marksheet Management System - an automated solution for generating and managing academic marksheets."

### Problem Statement:
"Traditional marksheet creation involves manual data entry, calculations, and formatting - taking 15-20 minutes per student with high error probability. Our system reduces this to under 3 minutes with 100% accuracy."

### Demo Intro:
"Let me demonstrate the live application deployed on Railway cloud platform..."

### Technical:
"We used Python Flask for backend, MySQL for database, and deployed on Railway. The system uses a 3-tier architecture..."

### Conclusion:
"Our system successfully achieves 80% time reduction, eliminates calculation errors, and provides 24/7 cloud access. Thank you!"
