# Marksheet Generator - Update Summary

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Missing `/verify` Route
**Problem:** Flask debugger was appearing because the `/verify` route was missing.

**Solution:** Added a new `/verify` route in `app.py` that:
- Shows a verification form on GET request
- Accepts verification code (roll number) on POST request
- Displays the marksheet if verification is successful
- Shows error messages for invalid codes

### 2. New Marksheet Design
**Problem:** The marksheet was too "zoomed in" and didn't match the desired clean design.

**Solution:** Created a new `result.html` template based on your specifications:

#### Features:
- ✨ **Clean, Professional Layout** - Similar to the HTML you provided
- 📏 **Proper Spacing** - Normal padding and margins (not too zoomed)
- 🎨 **Blue Color Scheme** - Primary blue (#2563eb) for headers and borders
- 📊 **Well-Organized Sections**:
  - College header with logo
  - Student details in a clean grid
  - Marks table with alternating row colors
  - Result summary box with gradient background
  - Signature section with placeholders for images
  - College seal section
  - Verification information

#### Design Details:
- **Font Size:** Reduced to 13px base (from 14px) for better fit
- **Container:** Max-width 800px, centered with proper padding
- **Table Design:** Clean borders, blue headers, alternating row colors
- **Grade Colors:** 
  - A/A+ = Green (#059669)
  - B/B+ = Blue (#2563eb)
  - C = Orange (#d97706)
  - D/F = Red (#dc2626)
- **Print Optimization:** Full-color printing with exact color preservation

### 3. Updated CSS for Consistent Sizing
**Changes:**
- Base font size: 14px → 13px (less zoomed feeling)
- Reduced all heading sizes proportionally
- Tighter spacing throughout
- Better button alignment and symmetry
- Improved container max-widths

### 4. Action Buttons
Added three action buttons (visible on screen, hidden in print):
- 🖨️ **Print Marksheet** - Opens print dialog
- 💾 **Save as PDF** - Uses print dialog to save as PDF
- ← **Back to Generate** - Returns to generation page
