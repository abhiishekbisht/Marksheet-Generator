## Current Status: Ready to Deploy! âœ…

All files are configured and pushed to GitHub. Follow these steps:

---

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps

### STEP 1: Open Railway
**Action:** Visit https://railway.app

**What to do:**
1. Click **"Login with GitHub"**
2. Authorize Railway to access your repositories
3. You'll be redirected to Railway dashboard

---

### STEP 2: Create New Project
**Action:** Deploy from GitHub

**What to do:**
1. Click **"New Project"** button (top right)
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Find and select: **`abhiishekbisht/Marksheet-Generator`**
4. Click **"Deploy Now"**

**What happens:**
- Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app
- It will read `Procfile` and `requirements.txt`
- Deployment will start immediately

---

### STEP 3: Add MySQL Database
**Action:** Add database to your project

**What to do:**
1. In your project dashboard, click **"+ New"** button
2. Select **"Database"**
3. Choose **"Add MySQL"**
4. Wait 30 seconds for MySQL to provision

**What happens:**
- Railway creates a MySQL database instance
- Database credentials are automatically generated
- Environment variables are auto-linked to your app

---

### STEP 4: Configure Environment Variables
**Action:** Add Flask configuration

**What to do:**
1. Click on your **Flask service** (the web app, not MySQL)
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Click **"+ New Variable"**
4. Add these one by one:

```
Variable Name          | Value
-----------------------|----------------------------------------
SECRET_KEY             | gulzar-marksheet-secret-2024-railway
FLASK_ENV              | production
FLASK_DEBUG            | False
COLLEGE_NAME           | GULZAR GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS
COLLEGE_ADDRESS        | Academic Excellence Since 1995
```

**Important:** 
- Database variables (MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_USER, etc.) are **automatically configured** by Railway
- Don't manually add database variables - Railway handles them!

---

### STEP 5: Wait for Deployment
**Action:** Monitor deployment progress

**What to do:**
1. Click on your Flask service
2. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
3. Watch the build logs
4. Wait for green "Success" status (2-3 minutes)

**What to look for:**
```
âœ“ Building...
âœ“ Installing dependencies...
âœ“ Starting application...
âœ“ Deployment successful
```

---

### STEP 6: Generate Domain
**Action:** Get your public URL

**What to do:**
1. Click on your Flask service
2. Go to **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll to **"Networking"** section
4. Click **"Generate Domain"**
5. Railway will create URL like: `https://marksheet-generator-production.up.railway.app`

**Copy this URL** - this is your live app!

---

### STEP 7: Initialize Database Tables
**Action:** Create database tables

**Method 1: Using Railway CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Initialize database
railway run python init_db.py
```

**Method 2: Using Railway Shell**
1. In Railway dashboard, click on Flask service
2. Click **"Settings"** â†’ **"Shell"**
3. Run command: `python init_db.py`

**Method 3: Manual SQL (if above fails)**
1. Click on MySQL database service
2. Go to **"Data"** tab
3. Click **"Connect"**
4. Use any MySQL client to connect
5. Run the SQL from `init_db.py` manually

---

### STEP 8: Test Your App! ðŸŽ‰
**Action:** Verify everything works

**What to do:**
1. Visit your Railway URL
2. You should see the login page
3. Try logging in with:
   - **Admin:** username: `admin` / password: `admin123`
   - **Teacher:** username: `teacher` / password: `teacher123`

**Test these features:**
- âœ… Login works
- âœ… Dashboard loads
- âœ… Can generate marksheet
- âœ… Can upload logo
- âœ… Can view history

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Database connection error"
**Solution:**
- Check that MySQL service is running (green status)
- Verify environment variables are auto-configured
- Re-deploy the app (click "Deploy" again)

### Issue: "Application Error"
**Solution:**
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Verify all dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Make sure `Procfile` exists

### Issue: "Can't initialize database"
**Solution:**
- Install Railway CLI: `npm install -g @railway/cli`
- Run: `railway login` then `railway link`
- Run: `railway run python init_db.py`
